## A project on the use of API's and delivering a final product.

### Introduction
When we got the assignment, my first thought was... I don't want to make a weather app and I don't want to make a movie database.
While you can definitely make interesting projects about these subjects and in the meantime practice javascript.. I wanted to work a bit more out of the box, to not only challenge my coding skills but also start practicing how to come up with different kinds of ideas.

Another thing I immediately decided was: I'm going to use base css and not bootstrap or sass, just to resfresh those base css skills.

### Sprints

##### Day 1

General concepts phase. Tried out many idea's/API's. Noticed many of the free API's are pretty doodoo.
Didn't really start coding until day 2.

##### Day 2

The field.

Javascript day. The fetching went pretty smooth and I extracted the info I wanted out of the API without many hiccups.
I chose promises over async/await because I was more familiar with it even though we ended up using async for our group project. Next time I might try using the newer method again.

I also noticed having to google/stack overflow a bit less for basic javascript code and I banged out 75% of the base HTML and javascript this day. 

##### Day 3 and Day 4

The hill.

Oeh that last 25%. I had to experiment a lot with dynamic content creation in the DOM to really be able to display the results elements in my results container the way I wanted to. I have a feeling the solution I found could probably be a lot shorter. 

After this, the css part started..

This is the moment I both cursed and rejoiced the fact that I was going to use base CSS. I had forgotten so much but a lot returned faster than I expected and it made me take a look at flexbox and spacing etc. again.

##### Day 5

Restraint.

I had a working project so today was a day of learning, finalizing css and html, writing the README, lighthouse tests, validators etc...
Our first group project, some of our code/css broke in the last 2 hours and we had to bugfix like crazy so I tried to draw lessons from this and I really fought the urge to implement more features, potentially breaking my code.

### End thoughts

I'm quite happy with the final result even though it's quite basic and I still need to improve a LOT.

1. Things I enjoyed:
   - Learning a lot about javascript scopes, api's, dom creation etc etc..
   - Getting the hang of general javascript more and more.
   - Re-learning css principles and creating a more or less responsive site without bootstrap.
2. Things I want to improve:
   - Being able to do some more creative things with javascript and css, like subtle animations/events.
   - For both css and javascript: Writing more structured and more concise code. Finding more elegant solutions.
   - Really understanding what is happening under the hood.
   - Make better use of media queries when using base css/sass.
